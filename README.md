# python-101-class
adventures in python

Found these from when I learned python in CS101 class; I might revist them later.
The one text based maze game doesn't work properly when it attempts to solve the maze, as it crashes when it dead-ends if I remember correctly... 
The graphical maze -- although extremely basic -- works greats! To solve, one must hatch the egg then navigate to the lower right-hand corner.
